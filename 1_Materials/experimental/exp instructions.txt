This experiment is concerned with 
the structure of human associative 
memory.  This knowledge is structured 
in some way and the mental structure 
is thought to come about through 
a process of associative learning.  
For example, consider the word (and 
concept of) DOG.  We often see the 
word DOG appear in the same context 
as the word CAT.  “It’s raining cats 
and dogs.”  “I have two dogs, but my 
neighbor has a cat.”  And so on.  By 
experiencing the words CAT and DOG 
together many times, we develop an 
association (a mental connection) between 
them.  With lots of this kind of 
associative learning experience during 
our lives, we develop a very large 
and very complex associative memory.

Psychologists are interested in 
understanding the structure of 
associative memory and have several 
ways of investigating it.  One method 
of investigating associative memory 
is known as a test of “free association.”  
In free association tests, participants 
like you are given a series of words 
and are asked to respond to each word 
by writing wordsthat come to mind.

On the right side of this page, you 
will see 20 words. We want you to write 
FOUR (4) words for each word listed. 
This experiment should take 15 minutes 
or less.  Do not spend a lot of time 
thinking about the words.  Just type 
FOUR (4) words that come to mind for 
each box. We will ask you to redo the 
survey if there are not FOUR (4) words 
listed for each box to the right. You 
will take this study several times, 
but try to write down the words that 
you are currently thinking of. You can 
write words you've written before, but 
do not specifically try to write the same 
words each time.
