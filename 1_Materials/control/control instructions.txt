This experiment is concerned with 
the structure of human associative 
memory.  This knowledge is structured 
in some way and the mental structure 
is thought to come about through 
a process of associative learning.  
For example, consider the word (and 
concept of) DOG.  We often see the 
word DOG appear in the same context 
as the word CAT.  “It’s raining cats 
and dogs.”  “I have two dogs, but my 
neighbor has a cat.”  And so on.  By 
experiencing the words CAT and DOG 
together many times, we develop an 
association (a mental connection) between 
them.  With lots of this kind of 
associative learning experience during 
our lives, we develop a very large 
and very complex associative memory.

Psychologists are interested in 
understanding the structure of 
associative memory and have several 
ways of investigating it.  One method 
of investigating associative memory 
is known as a test of “free association.”  
In free association tests, participants 
like you are given a series of words 
and are asked to respond to each word 
by writing wordsthat come to mind.

In this experiment you will be asked to 
determine how many students out of 100 
would respond to a cue word with a specific 
target word during a free association task.  

Assume 100 college students from around the 
nation gave responses to each CUE word.  
How many of these 100 students do you think 
would have given the RESPONSE word?
