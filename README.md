Counting on Memory: How Expertise Shapes Our Numerical Judgments of Associations

📄 Overview

This project investigates how people estimate the associative strength between word pairs and how repeated interaction with stimuli (expertise) shapes bias and sensitivity in these judgments.

- Bias refers to systematic overestimation of association probabilities.
- Sensitivity reflects the ability to discriminate between high- and low-strength associations.
- Analyses compare participant-generated norms against established free association databases (Nelson et al., 2004; De Deyne et al., 2019).

📊 Data

- Norming dataset: Participant free association responses collected across five sessions.
- Reference databases:
- [@Nelson2004] Free Association Norms
- [@dedeyne2019] Small World of Words (SWOW) norms

🔧 Reproducibility

The analyses were conducted in R with the following key packages:

- tidyr, dplyr (data wrangling & visualization)
- nlme (linear mixed-effects models)
- papaja (manuscript formatting in APA style)
- patchwork (figure composition)
- rio (file opener)
